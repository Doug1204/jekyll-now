Lesson review

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>What and how did we learn today?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today was our first lesson in I.T. in Year 9. We walked in with absolutely no idea what we were going to do. At first we had to work out what something was on the board 'Gdkkn!' I found that it meant Hello!. We learnt that this is a cipher called a Caesar Cipher invented by, you guessed in, Julius Caesar. Mr Keen then talked about how our passwords could easily be hacked if someone really wanted to get into our account. </td>

    <td>Why did we learn this?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We learnt this so we can be aware of what computers are able to do and that we should have much longer passwords.</td>
